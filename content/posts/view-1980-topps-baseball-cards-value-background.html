    <h3>If baseball is america&#039;s national pastime, then collecting baseball cards is a close second.</h3>
    <p>Closets, crawl spaces, and attics across the country are baseball card values depend on many factors, like age, condition, scarcity, and the collectible market trends at the time. Rickey henderson and his 1980 topps rookie card took baseball and the hobby by storm at the beginning of the decade. I&#039;ve been collecting cards for over thirty years now. However, looking back now, some have actually increased in value after all these years.</p>
